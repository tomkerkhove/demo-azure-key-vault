# Sample - Azure Key Vault
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tomkerkhove/sample-azure-key-vault.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tomkerkhove/sample-azure-key-vault)

## Scenario Overview

### 1. Authentication
Simple authentication demo to highlight authentication:
- `/api/v1/secrets/basic-auth/{secretName}` - Shows how you can authenticate via basic authentication
- `/api/v1/secrets/managed-service-identity/{secretName}` - Shows how you can authenticate via Azure AD Managed Service Identity (MSI)

### 2. In-Memory Caching with automatic Service Bus authentication key rolling
Demo on how you can use in-memory caching to avoid hitting Azure Key Vault every time. It is also aware when an authentication key has been revoked and automatically gets the latest secret from Key Vault.

- `/api/v1/orders` - Will queue a message on a Service Bus Queue
    - Will retrieve Service Bus connection string for specific auth policy from Key Vault
    - Secret will be stored in-memory and metrics provide insights in cache hit/miss ratio
- Azure Automation is automatically rolling the authentication keys every day via PowerShell
